I created this game from a tutorial using pygame and it was fun.
and this is my first project so please dont laugh at it.. :P
It has some issues though hope you guys could help with that like.
The pygame.mixer() didnt work for me so I could only add the the one background music.
but not the usual game sounds.
feel free to do changes and make it even better.
hoping for the best possible outcomes by you guys.
